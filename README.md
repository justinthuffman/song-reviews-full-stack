#This is a list of top five bangers by genre.

#It pulls the list from a respository I created and uses Spring/MVC to display it on the web via HTML templates in the templates directory.

##I also added playable song links via iframe and Spotify. I entered spotify's URI as a variable in the repository and then staticly coded the link to the iframe spotify player inserting the correct URI depending on the song.

##This time around I've added a css style sheet to make it more presentable and have made it a truely full stack site. Categories connects to songs and information is displayed accordingly. 

~~##TODO-- I'd like to figure out how to make thymeleaf link category.id to their respective category.image. I feel like I got close, but had to revert to just non-clickable images due to time constraints.~~
